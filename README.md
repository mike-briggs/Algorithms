# Algorithms
Various implementations of known algorithms in Java

### Travel Planning
Used Dijkstra's Algorithm to calculate best flight paths from given .txt input

### Subset with Sum
Brute force and Horowitz/Sahni algorithms to caluculate a subset with a target sum k within a given array

```
Example:
Target:310
Input: [56, 34, 7, 3, 13, 96, 66, 62, 18, 71, 33, 2, 36, 14, 83]

Subsets found..... 

-------------------
TESTING HOROWITZ/SAHNI
-------------------
[7] -- and -- [62, 18, 71, 33, 36, 83]
Total Iterations: 314

-------------------
TESTING BRUTE FORCE
-------------------
[56, 3, 96, 66, 18, 71]
Total Iterations: 8120
```

### Huffman Coding
Encodes and decodes files using huffman coding

### Difference between files
Finds the line by line differences between two files using Dynamic programming
